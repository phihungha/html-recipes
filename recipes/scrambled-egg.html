        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Say goodbye to the days when you had to decide whether to make scrambled eggs or an omelet,
            since with this exciting breakthrough in the latest breakfast technology,
            you're able to have both at the same time.
            Serve this up with toast slathered with jam.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh marjoram</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh thyme</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons grated sharp white Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine eggs, salt, cayenne, parsley, marjoram, thyme,
                and white Cheddar cheese in a small bowl
                and beat with a fork until combined.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a small, nonstick pan over medium heat.
                Pour the egg mixture into the hot pan and use a rubber spatula to begin scrambling the eggs,
                moving constantly and scraping the sides of the pan as needed.
                Reduce heat to low when eggs start to come together. Continue cooking,
                stirring slowly but constantly, until you have achieved very wet,
                soft scrambled eggs. Turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Tilt the pan toward you and push all the eggs together at the bottom edge of the pan.
                Go around the edges with your spatula, tucking in and smoothing out the edges,
                as you form the eggs into an omelet that is no longer wet, but still moist.
                The curve of the pan will help the shaping.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat back to medium to help form a skin on the surface of the omelet, about 15 seconds.
                Remove from heat and carefully flop over onto a warm plate. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
